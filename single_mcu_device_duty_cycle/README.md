# Real-Time Non-Surfactant Emulsion Fuel Supply System (RTES)

RTES mainly consists of a mixing unit and water/fuel ratio controller. The RTES device is capable of producing a fuel emulsion without the presence of any additive to be directly delivered into the engine.

Benefits of RTES device implementation
- Reduction of CO emission by 12%
- Reduction of smoke emission by 50%
- Reduction of water contamination in lubricant oil
- Reduction of soot contamination in lubricant oil
